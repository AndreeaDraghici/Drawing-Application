### How to run the tool:
---------------------------------

The final step is adding in user interaction. Ultimately, this boils down to three main functions:

a **mousedown**, to tell us when the user has initiated drawing.

a **mousemove**, to track a user's mouse movement.

a **mouseup**, for when the user completes drawing.
